Historically there has been a sustained and continuing reduction in average LOS.

The model allows users to make assumptions about future reductions in LOS relating to some specific activity cohorts e.g. for over 75 patients admitted as an emergency but it is recognised that continued LOS reductions may also continue to be achieved for patients outside of these specific cohorts.

This mitigator therefore allows users to set assumptions about the expected reduction in the average LOS for emergency admissions that are not covered by the other specific efficiency mitigators.

The assumed % reduction is applied to the average LOS which, in this case, is calculated excluding 0-day LOS spells as these cannot be further reduced. The chart on this page also shows the average LOS calculated in this way.
