Smoking is the biggest single cause of preventable death and ill-health within England. Reducing smoking prevalence through investment in smoking cessation services and public health interventions aimed at reducing take up will reduce admissions for a wide range of smoking attributable conditions. In addition historical measures such as national smoking bans will continue to have impact in future.

The 2018 Royal college of physicians report [Hiding in plain sight][rcp_hps] provides a list of conditions and their associated ICD10 codes that can be attributable to smoking along with an estimate of the percentage of cases that are attributable to smoking (the smoking attributable fraction (SAF)). The model uses this list to identify spells in the model that could be avoided.

Whilst most activity mitigation strategies identify all spells based on the specified SQL coding in this case the tool only selects a proportion of spells based on the smoking attributable fraction (SAF) for that condition. As an example the SAF for cancer of the larynx for males is 43% therefore the model randomly selects 43% of spells meeting these criteria. The SAFs are also sourced from the above referenced document.
