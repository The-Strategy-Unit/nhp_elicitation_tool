Outpatient attendances are by far the most voluminous activity undertaken in the NHS. They can be simply categorised into those that are new or first consultations initiated following a referral (usually from a GP) and those that are “follow ups” such as consultations following a surgical procedure to assess progress or outcomes or to assess the effectiveness of an ongoing treatment programme. Whilst many (most) follow up attendances are entirely appropriate it is generally accepted that some are unnecessary and there remains wide variation in follow up to new ratios. Within the tool 4 sub factors of this type are available:

Surgical specialties
Adults
