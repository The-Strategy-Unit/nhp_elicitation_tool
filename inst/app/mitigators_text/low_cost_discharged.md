Some ED attendances may not require the facilities or the highly skilled ED staffing and could be safely and effectively treated within alternative urgent care settings or through improved same day access to Primary care. The model identifies potential attendances of this type where the HRG code indicates that no treatments or investigation were undertaken or if there were they were low cost (minor) treatments or investigations.

Within the tool 4 sub factors of this type are available:

* Walk in attendances
  - Adults
  - Children
* Ambulance attendances
  - Adults
  - Children
